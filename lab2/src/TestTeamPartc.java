/*Develop a menu driven application called TestTeamPartc that allows the user to add, remove and list Team objects.
  For this use an ArrayList of Team.  What are the advantages of using an ArrayList over an array?
   Place the answer in a comment at the end of your code.*/

/*
Arraylists can shrink and grow dynamically, while arrays are fixed.
 We can add elements at a given position into the Arraylist.
Its faster and cleaner to code as it has access to methods, such as add(),remove(),set() ect.
